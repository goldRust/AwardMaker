# AwardMaker
Simple program to make door decoration awards for medaling in Forensics or Debate.

I built this project to help expediate making little awards to celebrate my students who earned a medal at a Forensics or Debate tournament. 
I used to spend hours after each meet creating little printable awards using photoshop -- with this project, I just have to input their name, event, and place and it generates a PDF for me.

It can also put a team photo on the generated PDF, complete with the name of the team and the tournament name given by the user.

I used AppJar to create the GUI that makes this program look decent and simplifies the input process. 

In order to use this for yourself, you'd need change the value of the "team_name" variable on line 81 to your own school's team name. Otherwise, it should work just about anywhere.

To customize the look of the awards, you could swap in new png files for each of the images used (gold, silver, bronze)
